# DAO_methods_generator
First you should draw your class diagram with Draw.io and save it in XML file format then use it in this program to generate codes!                                                                 
The second step is to give your XML file directory, output directory, package name and project name as inputs. The program will generate DAO interface and methods inside that package and directory you've given as inputs.
