First, you should draw your class diagram using Draw.io and save it in XML file format. Then, use this file in the program to generate codes. The second step is to provide the program with your XML file directory, output directory, package name, and project name as inputs. The program will generate a DAO interface and methods inside the specified package and directory you've provided.
